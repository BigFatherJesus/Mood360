Last updated: September 24, 2025

Mood360 is a professional mental health tracking application developed by Nuallan. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App processes, how it is used, secured, and your choices. If you have any questions, feel free to send an email to info@nuallan-ai.com, and I will reach out as soon as possible.

## Summary
- We do not collect, transmit, or sell personal data.
- All mood tracking, clinical assessments, and personal data are stored locally on your device with AES-256 encryption.
- The App uses local (on-device) notifications for reminders and wellness prompts if you enable them.
- Clinical questionnaire responses are processed locally for evidence-based mental health insights.
- You can export or delete your data at any time from within the App.

## Information We Process
### App Content You Provide
- **Mood Tracking Data**: Daily mood scores (1-5 scale), activities, sleep quality ratings, and personal notes
- **Clinical Assessment Responses**: Answers to evidence-based questionnaires (PHQ-9, GAD-7, Wellbeing scales) for mental health insights
- **Medication Information**: Medication names, dosages, and reminder schedules for tracking purposes
- **Personal Profile**: Name, gender, birthdate for personalized wellness recommendations
- **App Settings**: Language preferences, notification settings, PIN security preferences, and clinical feature toggles
- **Export Data**: When you choose to export, the app generates CSV/PDF files containing your data

All information is stored locally on your device with AES-256-GCM encryption through our SecureKV service. There is no account creation, no cloud sync, and no data transmission to external servers.

### Device Permissions
- **Notifications**: If enabled, the App schedules local notifications for medication reminders, mood check-ins, and wellness prompts. All notification content is generated on-device.
- **Storage**: The app requires storage permissions to save your encrypted data locally and generate export files.

We do not use analytics SDKs, advertising networks, crash reporting services, or any third-party data collection tools.

## How We Use Information
- **Core Functionality**: Tracking mood entries, calculating clinical assessment scores, displaying insights, and generating analytics dashboards
- **Personalization**: Customizing wellness recommendations, motivational content, and reminder scheduling based on your preferences
- **Clinical Insights**: Processing PHQ-9, GAD-7, and Wellbeing questionnaire responses to provide evidence-based mental health scoring and trends
- **Medication Management**: Tracking medication intake, calculating delays, and scheduling personalized reminder notifications
- **Data Export**: Generating CSV/PDF reports with clinical scores for personal use or sharing with healthcare providers
- **Security**: Implementing PIN-based app locking if you choose to enable this privacy feature

We do not use your information for marketing, advertising, analytics, or any commercial purposes. We do not sell, share, or transmit your data to third parties under any circumstances.

## Data Storage and Security
- **Local Storage**: All data is saved exclusively on your device using React Native's AsyncStorage with our custom SecureKV encryption wrapper
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: All sensitive data including mood entries, clinical responses, medication information, and personal profile data is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256-GCM encryption
- **No Cloud Sync**: Zero data transmission to external servers, databases, or cloud services at any time
- **PIN Protection**: Optional 4-digit PIN lock screen to prevent unauthorized app access
- **Export Security**: When you export data, files are generated locally and saved to your device's storage - you control where and how to share them
- **Data Isolation**: Each app installation maintains its own encrypted data store with no cross-device synchronization

## Data Retention and Deletion
- Retention: Data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.
- Deletion: You can delete entries within the App or remove the App to delete all locally stored data. Exports you created and saved elsewhere must be deleted separately from those locations.

## Children's Privacy and Clinical Disclaimers
- **Age Restrictions**: The App is intended for individuals 13 years and older due to its clinical assessment content. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
- **Clinical Content**: The app includes validated clinical questionnaires (PHQ-9, GAD-7) that are medical screening tools. Minors should consult with parents/guardians and healthcare providers before using clinical features.
- **Not Medical Advice**: This app provides wellness tracking and screening tools but is not a substitute for professional medical care, therapy, or psychiatric treatment.
- **Crisis Resources**: The app includes crisis support resources and encourages users to seek immediate professional help for mental health emergencies.

## Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access, correction, portability, or deletion of your data. Because data is stored on your device, all rights can be exercised directly within the App by viewing, exporting, or deleting entries.

## International Transfers
We do not operate servers for this App and do not transfer your App data internationally. If you choose to store exports using third-party services, those providers may process data subject to their own policies.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the App or legal requirements. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after an update signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.
